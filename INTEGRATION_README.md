# 🌱 Farmer-Consumer Product Integration

## Overview
This system connects farmers and consumers by allowing farmers to list their products and consumers to browse and purchase them. The integration uses localStorage for data persistence and provides a seamless experience across different user roles.

## How It Works

### 🚜 For Farmers:
1. **Login** as a farmer using credentials from `test-credentials.md`
2. **Access** the farmer dashboard at `/farmer-dashboard.html`
3. **Add Products** using the "Add New Produce" button
4. **Manage Products** with edit/delete functionality
5. **View Statistics** showing total listings, available products, and total value

### 🛒 For Consumers:
1. **Login** as a consumer using credentials from `test-credentials.md`
2. **Browse Products** at `/consumer-dashboard.html`
3. **Search & Filter** products by category or search terms
4. **View Details** including farmer information, location, and organic status
5. **Add to Cart** with persistent cart functionality

## Data Flow

```
Farmer Dashboard → Add/Edit Products → localStorage (farmer_products_{user_id})
                                           ↓
Consumer Dashboard → Load All Products → Display with Farmer Info → Add to Cart
```

## Key Features

### ✅ Product Management (Farmers)
- **Complete CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, Delete products
- **Rich Product Data**: Name, category, description, price, quantity, dates, location, organic status
- **Image Support**: Product images with fallback defaults
- **Real-time Statistics**: Dashboard updates automatically
- **User Isolation**: Each farmer's products are stored separately

### ✅ Product Discovery (Consumers)
- **Dynamic Loading**: Products from all farmers displayed automatically
- **Search Functionality**: Search by product name, description, category, or farmer
- **Category Filtering**: Filter by Vegetables, Fruits, Grains, Dairy, etc.
- **Farmer Information**: See who's selling each product and their location
- **Organic Indicators**: Clear marking of organic products

### ✅ Shopping Cart
- **Persistent Cart**: Cart data saved per consumer
- **Product Details**: Full product and farmer information in cart
- **Quantity Management**: Add multiple quantities of same product
- **Cross-Session**: Cart persists across browser sessions

## Testing the Integration

### Method 1: Manual Testing
1. **Start Server**: `node server.js`
2. **Login as Farmer**: Go to `/login.html`, use `farmer101` / `hash1`
3. **Add Products**: Use farmer dashboard to add products
4. **Switch to Consumer**: Login as `consumer_jane` / `hash2`
5. **Browse Products**: See farmer products in consumer dashboard

### Method 2: Automated Testing
1. **Open Test Page**: Go to `/test-integration.html`
2. **Run Tests**: Click buttons in sequence to test all functionality
3. **Verify Results**: Check that products flow from farmer to consumer

## Data Storage

### Farmer Products
- **Key Pattern**: `farmer_products_{user_id}`
- **Data Structure**:
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1642781234567,
    "farmer_id": 1,
    "name": "Fresh Tomatoes",
    "category": "Vegetables",
    "description": "Organic red tomatoes",
    "price": 45.0,
    "quantity": 50,
    "unit": "kg",
    "harvest_date": "2024-01-20",
    "expiry_date": "2024-01-30",
    "location": "Ahmedabad, Gujarat",
    "organic": true,
    "image_url": "https://...",
    "status": "available",
    "created_at": "2024-01-20T10:00:00Z"
  }
]
```

### Consumer Cart
- **Key Pattern**: `cart_{user_id}`
- **Data Structure**:
```json
[
  {
    "productId": 1642781234567,
    "farmerId": 1,
    "productName": "Fresh Tomatoes",
    "price": 45.0,
    "unit": "kg",
    "quantity": 2,
    "farmerName": "Ravi Patel",
    "addedAt": "2024-01-20T15:30:00Z"
  }
]
```

## Troubleshooting

### Products Not Showing for Consumers?
1. Ensure farmer has added products
2. Check localStorage for `farmer_products_*` keys
3. Verify user data is loaded (`userData` in localStorage)
4. Check browser console for errors

### Cart Not Working?
1. Ensure user is logged in as consumer
2. Check `cart_{user_id}` in localStorage
3. Verify product IDs match between farmer and consumer views

### Search/Filter Not Working?
1. Ensure products are loaded first
2. Check that user data contains farmer information
3. Verify search terms match product data

## Success Indicators
✅ Farmers can add/edit/delete products
✅ Products appear in consumer dashboard
✅ Search and filtering work correctly
✅ Cart functionality persists data
✅ Farmer information displays with products
✅ Organic products are clearly marked
✅ Real-time statistics update for farmers
